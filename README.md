# xivdiagrams

An experiment to help create raid diagrams for FFXIV, heavily inspired by [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/), Fabric.js, Figma, and others.

Roadmap, listed in priority order:

- tool selection
- drag to create
- player/enemy markers
- title, author, notes, steps
- backend sync (create, edit, view)
- copy/paste
- keybinds (bksp, del, esc, ctrl+c, ctrl+v)
- object/mechanic markers
- entity properties
- freehand tool
- ? grid, snap-to
- ? searchable debuffs for players
- ? fight-specific bg
- ? undo/redo
- ? scale selected items
